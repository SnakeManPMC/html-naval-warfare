	<h2>About This Website</h2>

<p>
Naval Warfare and Fleet Tactics website by PMC, was created because I wanted to give a rough overview of war at the sea for people who have not studied anything related to this subject, perhaps they only seen some hollywood movies about US Navy or similar, this website should give them very nice beginner level introduction to how are wars fought in the open seas, what kind of units, equipment and weapons are used. This will be very generic, while I might talk about A-6 Intruders, Sidewinders or Tomahawk TLAM's etc specifically, this website is not a accurate reference but a friendly guidance, do your own research for higher detail specifications.
</p>

<p>
Also this website is a nice reference even for me, there are so much information especially the more detailed parts, that when I research it today its most likely forgotten few months, years not to mention decades from now. Its very nice to have my own neatly packed and organized naval warfare index or glossary whatever its called of all kinds of cool technolgy and tactics stuff.
</p>

<p>
Naval Warfare website will be heavily linked by other PMC websites which cover various "video games" or simulations relating to naval warfware and fleet tactics. Perhaps the most reputable and serious game/simulator is <a href="https://cmano.pmctactical.org" target="_blank">Command Modern Air/Naval Operations (CMANO)</a> where players benefit from this websites easy to read and understand information. See <a href="links.php">links page</a> for the full list.
</p>

<p>
I started to create this website in 2024-10-13 and all dates/timestamps in the website use UTC format.

If you submit corrections or additions, you'll get full credit for it.

<p>
Hopefully you find Naval Warfare and Fleet Tactics website by PMC educational, just remember to do your own research if you really want to learn this stuff.
